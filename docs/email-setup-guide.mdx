# 📧 Setting Up Email Notifications - A Super Simple Guide

Hey there! Let's set up email notifications for your StreamClips AI app. I'll explain everything step by step, like we're building with LEGO blocks! 🎨

## 🎯 What We're Building

Your app will send emails to users when:
- They sign up (Welcome email! 👋)
- Their video clips are ready (Yay! 🎬)
- Something goes wrong (Oops, but we'll help! 🔧)
- They upgrade their subscription (Thanks! 💎)

## 📦 What You'll Need

Think of these as your LEGO pieces:
1. **Resend Account** - This sends the emails (like a mail truck 🚚)
2. **Clerk Webhooks** - This tells us when someone joins (like a doorbell 🔔)
3. **Your Code Editor** - Where we'll put everything together

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Get Your Resend Account (The Mail Truck)

### A. Sign Up for Resend

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) 
2. Click the big "Sign Up" button
3. Use your email to create an account (it's free to start!)

### B. Get Your Special Key (API Key)

1. After logging in, you'll see your dashboard
2. Look for a section called "API Keys" on the left sidebar
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Give it a name like "StreamClips Emails"
5. Copy the key that starts with `re_` - **Save this somewhere safe!** 🔑

<Callout type="warning">
⚠️ Your API key is like a password - don't share it with anyone!
</Callout>

### C. Add the Key to Your App

1. Open your project folder
2. Find the file called `.env.local` (if you don't have one, create it!)
3. Add this line at the bottom:
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_KEY_HERE
   ```
   (Replace `re_YOUR_KEY_HERE` with your actual key)

## 🔔 Step 2: Set Up Clerk Webhooks (The Doorbell)

This tells your app when someone new signs up!

### A. Go to Your Clerk Dashboard

1. Log in to [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
2. Click on your StreamClips project

### B. Create a Webhook Endpoint

1. In the left sidebar, find "Webhooks"
2. Click "Add Endpoint"
3. For the URL, put:
   ```
   https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/webhooks/clerk
   ```
   (Replace `your-app-name` with your actual Vercel app name)

<Callout type="info">
💡 If you're testing locally, you can use a tool called ngrok to create a temporary URL!
</Callout>

### C. Choose What to Listen For

1. Check these boxes:
   - ✅ `user.created`
   - ✅ `user.updated` 
   - ✅ `user.deleted`
2. Click "Create"

### D. Get Your Webhook Secret

1. After creating, you'll see your webhook in the list
2. Click on it
3. Look for "Signing Secret" 
4. Copy this long string of letters and numbers
5. Add it to your `.env.local` file:
   ```bash
   CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET_HERE
   ```

## 💾 Step 3: Update Your Database (Adding New Shelves)

Your database needs a new table to remember who wants which emails!

### Run This Command:

Open your terminal (the black window where you type commands) and run:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

This adds a new "preferences" table to your database - like adding a new shelf to store user choices! 📚

---

## 🎨 Step 4: Test Your Emails (Make Sure They Look Pretty)

### See How Your Emails Look:

1. Start your app locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to these URLs to preview each email:
   - Welcome Email: `http://localhost:3000/api/emails/preview?template=welcome`
   - Clips Ready: `http://localhost:3000/api/emails/preview?template=processing-complete`
   - Processing Failed: `http://localhost:3000/api/emails/preview?template=processing-failed`
   - Subscription Email: `http://localhost:3000/api/emails/preview?template=subscription-confirmation`

## 🧪 Step 5: Test Everything Works!

### A. Test Welcome Emails

1. Sign up for a new account on your app
2. Check your email - you should get a welcome message! 🎉

### B. Test Processing Emails

1. Upload a VOD and click "Analyze"
2. Wait for it to finish
3. Check your email - you should get a "clips ready" message!

### C. Let Users Control Their Emails

Users can now go to `/dashboard/settings/notifications` to turn emails on/off!

## 🚨 Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)

### Email Not Sending?

1. **Check your API key** - Make sure it's in `.env.local`
2. **Restart your app** - Sometimes it needs a fresh start:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Check Resend dashboard** - Log in to Resend and check if emails are being sent

### Webhook Not Working?

1. **Check the URL** - Make sure it matches your app exactly
2. **Check the secret** - Make sure it's copied correctly in `.env.local`
3. **Check Clerk logs** - In Clerk dashboard, check webhook logs for errors

---

## 📝 Quick Checklist

Before going live, make sure you have:

- [ ] Resend API key in `.env.local`
- [ ] Clerk webhook secret in `.env.local`
- [ ] Run `npm run db:push` to update database
- [ ] Tested welcome email by signing up
- [ ] Tested processing emails with a VOD
- [ ] Checked email preview pages look good

## 🎉 You Did It!

Your app now sends beautiful emails to keep users happy and informed! 

### What's Next?

- **Custom Domain**: Set up a custom email domain in Resend (like noreply@yourdomain.com)
- **Email Templates**: Customize the email designs in the `/emails` folder
- **More Notifications**: Add emails for other events like password resets
